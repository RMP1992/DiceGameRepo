# Introduction
I am making a dice game, where two player each get to roll the dice. To win the game the player must score 21 points, if the palyers rolls a 1 its game over and the score resets.
## Things that I like so far
I am really happy with the design of the game in terms of css.
### Things I still need to do 
I still need to move the text so that it appears beneath the picture of the dice. The dice pictures still need to change depending the number generated by the math.random function. And finally I need to make this game two player.
